Rancher vs OpenShift
--------------------

Having used OpenShift at work - not always a pleasant experience - as well as
having read through a number of comparison blogs / articles, my preference for
a new Kubernetes set-up would be Rancher. The key reasons for this are:

- Easier and faster to set-up (OpenShift can be notoriously difficult)

- Alignment with existing open source tools / approaches, rather than vendor
  specific tools

- Lower licensing costs for a typical set-up

- Tracks upstream component versions more closely 

- Lower degree of vendor lock-in due to use of upstream open source tools /
  frameworks as-is (not forked / modified versions as with OpenShift)

- Easier to upgrade (at work, we are currently struggling with OCP 4 upgrade)

- Support for public cloud providers is equally good - the additional on-prem
  architectures supported by OpenShift (Power, Z) are unlikely to be of use in
  non-specialised use cases 

The only risk I can see with Rancher is about the future of the company behind 
it: it is clearly much smaller than IBM, and the impact of the recent SUSE 
acquisition on the future of the product is yet to be seen. But given the 
low degree of vendor lock-in, the risk introduced by this uncertainty should 
be manageable.
